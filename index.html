          <h2>Why Genoa?</h2>
          <h3>Genoa, knonw for its stunning Renaissance</h3>
          <p>
            The historical centre, also known as old town, of Genoa is one of
            the largest and most-densely populated in Europe. Part of it was
            also inscribed on the World Heritage List (UNESCO) in 2006 as Genoa:
            Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli. Genoa's
            historical city centre is also known for its narrow lanes and
            streets that the locals call "caruggi". Genoa is also home to the
            University of Genoa, which has a history going back to the 15th
            century, when it was known as Genuense Athenaeum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Genoa, which forms the southern corner of the Milan-Turin-Genoa
            industrial triangle of Northwest Italy, is one of the country's
            major economic centers. A number of leading Italian companies are
            based in the city, including Fincantieri, Leonardo, Ansaldo Energia,
            Ansaldo STS, Edoardo Raffinerie Garrone, Piaggio Aerospace,
            Mediterranean Shipping Company and Costa Cruises.

                It is at the very heart of the city that Genoa changes face. The
                charming and characteristic architecture of the old town, where
                the scents of Ligurian cuisine - such as focaccia and freshly
                fried fish - mingle with the smell of the sea, to then give way
                to an elegant widening where the sunlight and the splendour of
                the buildings dominates the scene.
