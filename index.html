          <h3>Genoa, knonw for its stunning Renaissance</h3>
          <p>
            The historical centre, also known as old town, of Genoa is one of
            the largest and most-densely populated in Europe.[13] Part of it was
            also inscribed on the World Heritage List (UNESCO) in 2006 as Genoa:
            Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli. Genoa's
            historical city centre is also known for its narrow lanes and
            streets that the locals call "caruggi".[14] Genoa is also home to
            the University of Genoa, which has a history going back to the 15th
            century, when it was known as Genuense Athenaeum.

            Genoa, which forms the southern corner of the Milan-Turin-Genoa
            industrial triangle of Northwest Italy, is one of the country's
            major economic centers.[15][16] A number of leading Italian
            companies are based in the city, including Fincantieri,
            Leonardo,[17] Ansaldo Energia,[18] Ansaldo STS, Edoardo Raffinerie
            Garrone, Piaggio Aerospace, Mediterranean Shipping Company and Costa
            Cruises.
